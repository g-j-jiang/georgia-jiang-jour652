				<p>American fast food companies have been sparring it out in the chicken sandwich wars for years. It all started when Popeyes launched its spicy masterpiece in 2019: a sandwich so coveted that one man was reportedly stabbed to death after an in-store fight erupted over someone jumping the queue. Popeyes saw a 38% jump in store sales post launch—and fast food brands have been vying for even a nugget of that success since. In 2021, Burger King entered the ring. This summer, Starbucks sent its chicken-and-egg sandwich into battle (and some customers claimed it gave them diarrhea). Wingstop also relaunched its formerly-sold out chicken sandwiches in October, causing its stock price to climb nearly 7% overnight.</p>

                <p>Chicken sandwiches offer a triumvirate of appealing things: crispy, salty, and affordable. Inflation has increased the average price by about 18%, but most still cost less than $5. Even as labor and supply chain issues supposedly created a poultry shortage this year, the flood of chicken sandwiches just kept on coming—and many experts believe they won’t stop. “Flavor, bun, topping, and coating innovation will continue to drive interest,” says Claire Lancaster, the Head of Food & Drink at trend forecasting company WGSN. So will hyped up drops and the relentless rhetoric that chicken is more sustainable and healthier than beef, which has seen a 40% drop in sales since 2003.</p>

                <br>

                <p>There’s one other major driver fueling the chicken sandwich wars: the American poultry industry, which is designed to crank out astronomical amounts of cheap meat. Years of corporate consolidation, and an increasing appetite for chicken, has made poultry one of most prolific fast food staples in the US. But it’s come at great cost. Experts say we have so many affordable chicken sandwiches on the market because poultry farmers, meat processing workers, chickens, and the environment are being treated terribly while corporations profit.</p>

					</p>
				</blockquote>

				<p>Of course, the meat industry’s failings are well-documented. But in line, waiting for a taste of golden fried chicken as the smell of hot oil hijacks all sense of morality, it’s easy to forget.</p>

                <p class="chapter-head">History of the Modern American Chicken</p>

				<p>Chicken sandwiches wouldn’t exist without this country’s love of poultry in general—an obsession that’s been decades in the making. Sixty years ago, Americans ate about 32 pounds of chicken per person. In 2021, that figure had grown to over 98 pounds.</p>

				<p>Chickens first arrived on Columbus’s second voyage to the Americas in 1493, historian Emelyn Rude wrote in Tastes Like Chicken: A History of America’s Favorite Bird. But for most early colonists, the birds were primarily kept as egg-layers, eaten only when they were old and useless. “They were probably tough and not so amazing tasting,” says Carolyn Dimitri, an associate professor of food studies at NYU.</p>

				<p>That all started to change in 1946, when the quest for bigger, better birds began. The USDA, along with a slew of prominent poultry businesses, announced the “Chicken of Tomorrow” competition, Rude wrote. For poultry to compete with beef and pork, the dominant proteins on the American dinner plate at the time, it needed to be meatier and more tender—and the farmer who bred a chicken with the juiciest breasts would win $5,000. Subsequent nutrition, veterinary, and indoor housing innovations supported super chicken growth. By the 1950s, Americans were digging the plumped-up new birds.</p>

				<p>Then, big poultry companies began acquiring smaller ones in the 1960s. The industry has since become so consolidated that the five largest companies—Tyson Foods, Pilgrim’s, Sanderson Farms, Perdue, and Koch Foods—now control about 61% of US chicken production. These mega-corporations have drastically driven chicken prices down and availability up. Poultry has now overthrown beef and pork as America’s favorite meat. It’s a shift that the USDA partially chalks up to fast food restaurants—and their increasingly popular nuggets and sandwiches. </p>

				<p>“If you were scored on how much meat you produced, [the current] system would score very high,” said Ricardo Salvador, director of the food and environment program for the Union of Concerned Scientists. “If you were scored on the environmental and social impact, you would score very low, and you don’t get away with just being scored on one.”</p>

				<p>In some ways, it’s impressive that big chicken companies have figured out how to feed millions of people so cheaply and reliably, especially as the cost of living outpaces wage growth. That consolidation is also what’s primed poultry for fast food businesses, which need to sell huge amounts of cheap food to turn a profit.</p>

				<p>But there are various latent consequences when companies keep their meat so cheap and abundant: poor labor conditions, animal welfare issues, and environmental detriment. “All of the hidden costs [of a cheap chicken sandwich] have to be displaced somewhere,” says Carrie Freshour, an assistant geography professor at the University of Washington and the author of the colloquium, From Chicken to Broiler: Unraveling the Snarl of Centuries.</p>

				<p> Sara Scherr, chief executive of ExoAgriculture Partners, says that industrial meat production carries larger-scale risks, including those associated with animal diseases, which can threaten human health. Her Washington-based nonprofit promotes decentralized agricultural production across the United States. “It makes a lot of sense to have a more decentralized food system, for a lot of reasons.”</p>

				<p>However, current reality differs from this goal. The vast majority of poultry growers are part of what Douglas Constance, an agrifood sociologist at Sam Houston State University in Texas, calls the original “gig economy model.” Farmers own their land and facilities, and are responsible for providing the labor required to raise the birds to slaughter weight. Then, the poultry companies give the farmers chicks, feed, and medicine. These contract growers are paid by the pound based on a system called the “tournament,” which ranks farmers against each other; those that grow birds bigger and faster than the median are paid more.</p>

                <p class="chapter-head">A New Economic Structure</p>

				<p>Proponents of contract farming say this financial model protects growers against market risks, such as fluctuating feed or medicine costs. According to USDA data from 2011, chicken farmers earned a median income of $68,455, and 60% of them made more money than the US-wide household median. “The business partnerships between chicken farmers and chicken companies are mutually beneficial, viable and profitable,” says Tom Super, senior vice president of communications at the National Chicken Council (NCC), which represents the biggest companies in the industry. </p>

				<p>Still, despite having to fork up millions of dollars to build and maintain high-tech chicken housing, many poultry growers end up earning only about 7 cents per pound for their birds. (In comparison, beef farmers earn about $1.42 per pound—though most are responsible for paying for their own feed and animals.) “Chicken farmers bear a lot of risk with the odds stacked against them for a reasonable return,” says Rob Larew, the president of the National Farmers Union. Farmers have long-complained about these conditions to the USDA, but speaking up is risky. They could “lose those contracts and therefore lose their farms because their loans would not be able to be repaid,” Larew argues.</p>

				<p>"Another way to produce more cheap meat is to butcher the birds faster. The speed at which chickens are processed on the slaughter line has doubled since 1979, from 70 birds per minute to 140 today. While the USDA sets poultry processing standards, critics have blamed industry influence for increasing line speeds. Some slaughterhouse employees have alleged they wear diapers because the dizzying pace of work makes bathroom breaks impossible. Various injuries and long term issues, such as “carpal tunnel syndrome, premature disability, and premature death,” are also more likely on a fast line, says Constance.</p>

                <p>The NCC, which filed a petition in 2017 asking the USDA to waive line speed limits at various plants, maintains conditions in poultry plants are safe for workers; it cites Bureau of Labor Statistics data that shows poultry processing injuries have been steadily declining since 2003. In large part, the NCC chalks that up to technological improvements within slaughterhouses. Super says the industry has also increased training and education, is designing tools to help with repetitive injuries, and has made various updates to safety gear. </p>

                <p>Over the years, chicken breeders have also figured out how to get more meat from each bird. Since the “Chicken for Tomorrow” competition in the ’40s, they’ve only gotten larger, while the feed required and time taken to reach market weight have both plummeted. Though chickens fill our brioche buns quickly and cheaply, these fast-growing birds have gotten so big they’re in constant pain, according to Vox. One two-year study of more than 7,500 chickens found that many can’t really move. Their bodies fail: They develop foot injuries, painful sores, and heart and lung problems. </p>

				<div class="graphics">
					<img src="images/chickens-then-and-now.png">
				</div>


                <p>Fast food sales—which account for about one quarter of total available chicken, according to extrapolated NCC data—have been one of the biggest drivers of these agricultural science innovations. Over the years, the health and the structure of the chicken has been genetically manipulated to serve specific product needs. “Birds are grown with very large breasts so they can pull those off and [use them to make] the chicken sandwich,” says Constance.</p>

                <p class="chapter-head">The Sustainability Issue</p>

                <p>Poultry is undoubtedly a more sustainable protein source than beef, which is the biggest agricultural polluter. According to an NCC report commissioned in 2020, the chicken industry has reduced its environmental impact in various key areas: Land use is down 13%, greenhouse gas emissions are down 18%, and water use is down 13%. It’s not exactly an impartial study, though. And chicken production still has massive impacts on our ecosystem. Growing the soy used in chicken feed has been directly linked to mass deforestation, and agricultural runoff from poultry farms is polluting the air and waterways. </p>

                <p>Since Popeyes started the chicken sandwich wars, almost every chain has paraded out new takes promising bouncier buns, fancy pickles, gourmet seasonings, and the holy grail: crispier, juicier chicken breasts. But pressure from animal welfare groups seems to be creating some change in the industry.</p>

                <p>In 2020, Popeyes signed the Better Chicken Commitment (BCC)—a pledge to adopt certain production standards intended to improve the lives of the chickens they buy. The commitment was introduced in 2017 and is managed by representatives from various organizations. Other fast food companies such as Shake Shack, Sonic, Burger King, and Starbucks are among over 200 other signees. Part of the protocol includes raising slower-growing birds; allowing them more space by reducing stocking density; providing improved litter and lighting conditions; and transitioning slaughterhouses from water bath stunning (where chickens are shackled and dragged through electrically charged water) to controlled atmosphere stunning (CAS), which is widely considered more effective and humane. </p>

				<div class="graphics">
					<img src="images/better-chicken-commitment.jpg">
				</div>

                <p>The majority of these commitments won’t manifest until 2024 at the earliest, according to a BCC spokesperson, but some companies have already made strides. McDonald’s, while not currently signed on to the Better Chicken Commitment, has converted 60% of its US processing facilities to CAS. Poultry companies like Perdue and Wayne Farms have also agreed to supply BCC compliant chicken to interested parties. But a vegan chicken sandwich war might be more realistic than better-sourced poultry in the near term, as a slew of fake meats hit the market. Chains like Burger King and Slutty Vegan are already testing or selling plant-based chicken sandwiches—and vegan nuggets have gone mainstream at places like KFC, though these are cooked in the same fryers as the chicken. </p>

                <p>Still, plant-based substitutes have struggled to take off in a fast food setting, where they sit at moral odds with the rest of the menu. And Burger King, Popeyes, and Sonic have all weakened their policies since signing up for the BCC. “The reality is that most of the cheap chicken sold at fast food chains have extremely low welfare standards,” says a BCC spokesperson, “allowing cruelty to remain a cornerstone of their supply chains.”</p>
